These are miscellaneous scripts that I find useful for my research. This includes a better/faster "peace-year" function for binary time-series cross-section (BTSCS) research, my default ggplot theme that's flexible and aesthetically pleasing for LaTeX and the web, and a function for plotting levels of a random effect from a mixed effects model.
